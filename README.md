## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a video generation model that can generate smooth and coherent video sequences with a minimal computational footprint. The model consists of:

1. **Keyframe Autoencoder:**  
   A lightweight convolutional autoencoder that captures essential spatial features by encoding and decoding keyframes extracted from videos.

2. **Interpolation Module:**  
   A dedicated module that estimates motion between keyframes and uses differentiable warping along with a refinement network to interpolate intermediate frames.

This two-stage approach decouples spatial detail extraction from temporal dynamics, allowing for improved efficiency and lower resource consumption.

## Features

- **Dual-Stage Design:**  
  Combines keyframe extraction and interpolation for smooth video generation.
  
- **Lightweight Architecture:**  
  Uses efficient convolutional layers and shallow networks to reduce computational overhead.
  
- **Modular Codebase:**  
  Organized into separate modules for data processing, model definition, training, and utilities for ease of experimentation and extension.
  
- **Extensible:**  
  Easily add custom loss functions, additional modules, or new features as needed.
  
- **Edge-Ready:**  
  The design focuses on low resource consumption, which makes it suitable for deployment on edge devices.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/video_generation_project.git
   cd video_generation_project
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

Run the training script to start model training:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can adjust hyperparameters in `training/train.py` as needed.

### Evaluating the Model

Use the evaluation script in `training/evaluate.py` to generate outputs, calculate metrics, or visualize results.

## Training

The training pipeline integrates the keyframe autoencoder and interpolation module:

- **Dataset Preparation:** Videos are processed in `data/dataset.py` where keyframes are extracted based on a specified interval.

- **Loss Functions:** The training loop uses an L1 reconstruction loss for keyframe reconstruction and interpolation output. Additional custom losses can be added via `utils/losses.py`.

- **Optimization:** The model uses the Adam optimizer with configurable hyperparameters in the training script.

## Evaluation

Evaluation scripts help you:
- Calculate quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, temporal consistency)
- Visualize generated frames and compare with ground truth
- Fine-tune the model based on feedback
